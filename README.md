# Predicting YouTube Viewer Metrics with Machine Learning
For my Machine Learning project, I aim to investigate: *To what extent can video category and metadata (duration, bitrate, frame rate) predict the numerical value of views on YouTube videos using regression models measured by RMSE and R²?* I used [this YouTube dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cyberevil545/youtube-videos-data-for-ml-and-trend-analysis), cleaned the data, and conducted exploratory analysis to examine the distribution of engagement metrics. Multiple regression approaches were applied, including Linear Regression as a baseline model, then Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Engagement variables were highly skewed and weakly correlated with the available metadata, demonstrating limited predictive performance. Gradient Boosting performed the best (R² = 0.144, RMSE = 2.358), though it explained only a small portion of engagement variance. Feature-importance analysis and engagement-ratio comparisons showed that no strong or consistent predictors emerged despite a few relatively higher ratios for Gaming. Overall, the results indicate that basic video metadata provides minimal explanatory power, suggesting that most variation in YouTube engagement is driven by factors not captured in this dataset.
